This resource is used for your skills. The Green Bar shows your Stamina Points (SP). You can use your Stamina by pressing the Space Bar and clicking where you want to go in quick succession. This will make you walk much faster than normal until you get to where you clicked. Rest to quickly regenerate all of these (either press X or the red and blue Heart icon at the bottom-right)."
